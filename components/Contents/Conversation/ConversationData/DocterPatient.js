    "Hello! I'm Dr. Smith. Nice to meet you. How can I help you today?",
    "Hi, Dr. Smith. I've been experiencing some persistent headaches and wanted to get it checked out.",
    "I see. I'm sorry to hear that. Let's start by discussing your symptoms in more detail. When did the headaches begin, and have you noticed any specific patterns or triggers?",
    "The headaches started about two weeks ago, and they seem to occur mostly in the afternoons. I haven't identified any specific triggers, but the pain is moderate to severe.",
    "Thank you for sharing that information. Have you experienced any other symptoms along with the headaches, such as nausea, dizziness, or changes in vision?",
    "Yes, I've had some nausea, especially during the headaches, and occasional dizziness. My vision seems blurry at times too.",
    "I see. These symptoms are important for me to know. I'd like to perform a physical examination and, if necessary, order some tests to get a better understanding. Are you comfortable with that?",
    "Yes, I'm comfortable with that. What kind of tests do you recommend, and is there anything I should prepare for the examination?",
    "I'll start with a general physical examination and may order blood tests or imaging, such as an MRI, to rule out any underlying issues. For the examination, please wear comfortable clothing, and we'll proceed in the next room. Is that okay?",
    "Sure, that sounds fine. Also, is there anything I should avoid or any specific information you need from me before we proceed with the tests?",
    "Avoiding food for a few hours before the blood tests would be helpful. If you're taking any medications, please let me know. Otherwise, we'll discuss your medical history in more detail during the examination. Do you have any questions or concerns before we proceed?",
    "No, I don't have any specific concerns. I appreciate your thorough approach. What are the next steps after the examination and tests?",
    "After the examination and tests, we'll discuss the results, and I'll provide you with a diagnosis and treatment plan, if necessary. If there's anything urgent or you experience worsened symptoms, don't hesitate to contact me. Thank you for entrusting me with your care.",
    "Thank you, Dr. Smith. I appreciate your time and assistance. I'll proceed with the examination and tests as discussed.",
