    "Good [morning/afternoon/evening]! Welcome to Starlight Hotel. How may I assist you with your reservation today?",
    "Hello! I'd like to book a room for a two-night stay starting this Friday. Do you have availability?",
    "Certainly! I can check our availability for you. How many adults and children will be staying, and do you have any preferences for the type of room?",
    "It'll be for two adults. We'd prefer a non-smoking double room with a king-size bed, if possible.",
    "Great! I have a non-smoking double room with a king-size bed available for the dates you mentioned. Would you like to proceed with that?",
    "Yes, that sounds perfect. Can you provide the rate for the room, and are there any additional fees I should be aware of?",
    "The room rate is $120 per night, and there's a one-time booking fee of $10. So, for the two-night stay, the total would be $250. Is that acceptable?",
    "Yes, that's within our budget. How can I secure the reservation, and do you require any payment information upfront?",
    "To secure the reservation, I'll need your name, contact information, and a valid credit card to hold the room. The card won't be charged until you check in or if there's a cancellation policy violation. May I have the necessary details, please?",
    "Certainly. My name is [Your Name], and my phone number is [Your Phone Number]. The credit card I'll use is [Credit Card Details].",
    "Thank you for providing the information. Your reservation is confirmed for a non-smoking double room with a king-size bed for two nights starting this Friday. Is there anything else I can assist you with, such as special requests or information about the hotel amenities?",
    "That covers everything. Can you confirm the check-in and check-out times, and are there any nearby attractions you recommend?",
    "Certainly! Check-in is at 3:00 PM, and check-out is at 11:00 AM. As for nearby attractions, we have a brochure at the front desk with local recommendations. If you need anything during your stay, feel free to contact the front desk. Thank you for choosing Starlight Hotel!",
    "Thank you! I appreciate your assistance. I'm looking forward to our stay at Starlight Hotel.",
